# Wizard's Defense: A Java OOP Tower Defense Game
This project is a tower defense game developed in Java, utilizing the Processing library for graphics and Gradle for dependency management. The objective of the game is to strategically place and upgrade towers to prevent waves of enemies from reaching the wizard's house, ensuring that the wizard's mana does not run out.

## Project Overview
In this game, players must defend a wizard’s house from waves of enemies. The player can place and upgrade towers on a map using mana, the game's currency. Each time an enemy reaches the wizard's house, mana is expended to banish it. The challenge is to survive all enemy waves without depleting the wizard's mana.

## Objectives
**Game Mechanics Implementation**: Develop core gameplay mechanics, including tower placement, enemy movement, and mana management.
**Graphics and UI**: Utilize the Processing library to create game graphics and interface elements.
**Dependency Management**: Use Gradle to manage dependencies and streamline the development process.
**Object-Oriented Design**: Implement the game using Java's object-oriented principles, ensuring clean and maintainable code.

## Approach
**Game Design**: Designed the game mechanics based on the task description, including the interaction between towers, enemies, and mana.
**Object-Oriented Programming**: Implemented the game entities (e.g., towers, enemies, wizard’s house) using OOP principles, allowing for modular and extensible code.
**Graphics and Animation**: Utilized the Processing library to render the game map, towers, and enemies, as well as to handle animations and user interactions.
**Gradle Integration**: Set up Gradle as the dependency manager to streamline the build process and manage external libraries.

## Tools and Technologies
**Java**: For implementing the game logic and object-oriented design.
**Processing**: For rendering graphics and handling user interactions.
**Gradle**: For managing project dependencies and automating the build process.

## Results
The prototype successfully demonstrates the core gameplay mechanics, allowing players to strategically place and upgrade towers to defend the wizard’s house. The game offers a foundation for further development, including the addition of more complex features and refined graphics.
