#Mousehunt: A Text-Based Adventure Game in Python
This project is a text-based version of the Mousehunt game developed in Python. The game simulates a mouse-hunting adventure where players take on the role of a hunter, using different traps and cheeses to catch mice. The project was expanded in a second phase to incorporate object-oriented design principles, improving code organization and game mechanics.

## Project Overview
In the Kingdom overrun by mice, players act as hunters tasked with helping the King eradicate these pests. Success in hunts is rewarded with points and gold, contributing to the hunter's recognition in the Kingdom. The game begins with a simple version featuring basic gameplay, which was later expanded with additional features and a refined user interface.

## Objectives
### Initial Game Version:
Implement a text-based game with one location, one type of mouse, three types of traps, and one type of cheese.
Allow players to set their hunter's name, learn the game basics through a tutorial, buy cheese from the Cheese Shop, and engage in hunts.

### Expanded Game Version:
Introduce new features, including multiple types of mice and cheeses, improved traps with unique effects, and a more user-friendly interface.
Implement object-oriented design by creating classes for key game components such as Trap, Hunter, CheeseShop, and Interface.

## Approach
**Game Design and Mechanics**: Developed the initial game mechanics, including the trap selection, cheese arming, and hunting process. Players can buy cheese, set traps, and attempt to catch mice in a turn-based manner.
**Object-Oriented Design**: In the second phase, the game was refactored to follow object-oriented principles. This involved creating specific classes to manage game elements like traps, the hunter, the cheese shop, and the game interface.
**User Interface**: Enhanced the text-based user interface to better handle player inputs and provide visual feedback, such as displaying the coat of arms of caught mice.
**Profanity Filter**: Added a feature to generate neutral names if any profanities are detected in the playerâ€™s input, ensuring the game is family-friendly.

## Tools and Technologies
**Python**: Used for implementing the game logic and object-oriented structure.
**Text-Based Interface**: Designed for simplicity and ease of interaction in a terminal environment.

## Results
The project successfully creates an engaging text-based game that evolves from a basic mouse-hunting simulation to a more sophisticated, object-oriented design. The game offers a solid foundation for further enhancements, such as additional locations, mice, and gameplay mechanics.
