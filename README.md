# Survey Design and Data Analysis: A Comprehensive Data Science Project
This project showcases a complete data science workflow, from designing a survey and collecting data to performing detailed analysis using R, and presenting findings in both written and video formats. The project aims to investigate a specific research question through survey data, employing various statistical methods and visualization techniques to draw meaningful conclusions.

## Project Overview
The project involves designing a survey to collect data on a chosen topic, followed by a comprehensive analysis using numerical and graphical summaries. The investigation includes the application of appropriate statistical models and demonstrates proficiency in the R programming language, particularly with the ggplot2 package for data visualization. The results are then communicated through a detailed written report and a concise video presentation.

## Objectives

### Survey Design:
- Choose a research question and design a survey with around 10 well-structured questions, including at least two quantitative variables.
- Collect data through the survey, ensuring a diverse and representative sample.

### Data Analysis:
- Analyze the collected data using RStudio, focusing on numerical and graphical summaries.
- Utilize ggplot2 for creating insightful visualizations that support the findings.
- Apply appropriate statistical models, such as regression analysis, to explore relationships between variables.

### Reporting and Presentation:
- Prepare a written report tailored to a hypothetical client, providing concrete recommendations backed by evidence from the data.
- Produce a one-minute video presentation summarizing the key findings and recommendations.

### Approach

**1. Survey Design and Data Collection:** 
- Developed survey questions that align with the research question and ensure data collection on relevant variables.
- Deployed the survey online and collected responses over a specified period.

**2. Data Analysis in R:**
- Conducted data cleaning and preparation to ensure quality analysis.
- Used ggplot2 to create visual representations of the data, highlighting key trends and insights.
- Applied statistical models to investigate the relationships between variables and answer the research question.

**3. Reporting and Communication:**
- Drafted a report in a format suitable for a client, summarizing the analysis and providing actionable recommendations.
- Created a video presentation to effectively communicate the findings in a concise and persuasive manner.

### Tools and Technologies
- **R**: For data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
- **ggplot2**: For creating high-quality, informative graphics.
- **RMarkdown**: For compiling the written report with embedded code and outputs.

### Results
The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data science process, from data collection to analysis and reporting. The findings offer valuable insights that inform evidence-based decision-making, highlighting the power of data in answering complex research questions.
